Master Yoda asked me for a modern management system for the Order and Jedi Knights. I use Java Swing GUI in my application.
The main functionality of the application is the ability to display, record Jedi Orders and Knights and dynamically display
resources in the corresponding windows. To enable the rapid transfer of secret data to another planet in the event of an Imperial attack
the application has the ability to import and export data to a file with an encryption algorithm. All data from the app is stored in
database.

This is how the functionality of importing and exporting data to a file with the option of selecting a file works.
